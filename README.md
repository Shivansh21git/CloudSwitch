# CloudSwitch üå©Ô∏èüîå
Effortlessly Control Your Devices Anywhere, Anytime with Firebase, ESP8266 & MIT-App Inventor

# üöÄ Overview
Welcome to CloudSwitch, the ultimate IoT project where the power of cloud connectivity meets seamless control! With CloudSwitch, you can remotely control devices via a relay, using Firebase Cloud as the backbone for real-time data exchange. Whether you're looking to automate your home or build the next-gen IoT solution, CloudSwitch is your gateway to smart, efficient control.

# üéØ Features
*Remote Control:* Seamlessly control your relay from anywhere in the world via Firebase.  
*MIT App Inventor App:* A basic two-button interface for controlling your relay via Firebase.  
*Real-Time Monitoring:* Get instant updates and status reports on your connected devices.  
*Scalable Architecture:* Easily add more relays and devices to your setup without changing the core code.  
*Secure Communication:* Leverage Firebase's robust security protocols to ensure your devices are safe.  

# üõ†Ô∏è Hardware & Software Requirements
*ESP8266:* The heart of the project, responsible for connecting to Firebase and controlling the relay.  
*Relay Module:* The device to be controlled.  
*Power Supply:* A stable 3.3V or 5V power source for the ESP8266 and relay.  
*Firebase Account:* Create a Firebase project to store and manage your IoT data.  
*Arduino IDE:* Used for programming the ESP8266.  
*MIT App Inventor:* To create a simple mobile app for relay control.  

# üîß Setup Guide
*Hardware Setup:* Connect your ESP8266 to the relay module and power supply.  
*Firebase Configuration:* Set up a new Firebase project and obtain the API keys.  
*Programming the ESP8266:* Use the Arduino IDE to upload the CloudRelay code to your ESP8266.  
*Real-Time Control:* Open the Firebase console or your custom web app to control the relay in real-time.  

# üåê How It Works
At the core of CloudRelay is the integration between the ESP8266 and Firebase. The ESP8266 continuously listens for changes in the Firebase database by the application and toggles the relay state accordingly. This enables real-time control and monitoring of connected devices with minimal latency with a mobile application support.  

# üß† Learning Outcomes
